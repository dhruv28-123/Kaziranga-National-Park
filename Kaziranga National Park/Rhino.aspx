            <h2>Indian One-Horned Rhinoceros</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian one-horned rhinoceros, also known as the Greater One-Horned Rhino, is native to the Indian subcontinent. 
                Kaziranga National Park in Assam is home to the largest population of this majestic animal. 
                Rhinos are known for their thick skin, single horn, and a peaceful nature, although they can be aggressive if threatened. 
                They are herbivores and play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of grasslands.
