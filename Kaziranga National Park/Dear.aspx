            <h2>Swamp Deer (Barasingha)</h2>
            <p>
                The Swamp Deer, commonly known as Barasingha, is a graceful herbivore found in the marshy grasslands of Kaziranga National Park. 
                Its name, meaning "twelve-tined," refers to its distinctive antlers with multiple points. 
                Barasinghas are social animals that live in herds and feed on aquatic plants and grasses. 
                They are a symbol of the park’s rich biodiversity and are protected under Indian wildlife conservation laws due to their declining numbers in the wild.
