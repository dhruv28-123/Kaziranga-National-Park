            <h2>Indian Marsh Crocodile</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian Marsh Crocodile, also known as the Mugger Crocodile, is a freshwater species widely found in rivers, lakes, and marshes across India. 
                Kaziranga National Park provides a safe habitat for these ancient reptiles. 
                Muggers are distinguished by their broad snouts and strong swimming abilities. 
                They are carnivorous and often feed on fish, amphibians, and occasionally larger prey. 
                Their presence contributes to the natural aquatic balance of the park's ecosystem.
