The layout and design were planned to resemble the structure and appearance of a typical national park's official website.
It is created using HTML for content structure, CSS for styling, and ASP.NET for backend support. 
The site displays information about Kaziranga National Park, including images and text, using a clean and easy-to-navigate layout.
